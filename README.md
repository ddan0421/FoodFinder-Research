This report examines 110 food programs within Interstate 285, an Interstate Highway loop encircling Atlanta, Georgia. People in Atlanta commonly refer to this loop as “The Perimeter.” I compiled a list of 110 food programs within the Perimeter and organized the list based on crucial information such as contact(email, call), operating days/hours, services provided, and service areas that are MISSING for each entry. By looking at what is MISSING for each entry, we seek to observe the number of programs that have incomplete information, the locations of these programs, and the other negative effects of incomplete information on people/neighborhoods that experience severe food insecurity.
